Great question 👍. Since you’re just starting with **trees in Java**, let’s dive into **binary trees** and all their types.

---

# 🔹 What is a Binary Tree?

A **binary tree** is a tree data structure where **each node can have at most two children** (commonly referred to as `left` and `right`).

---

# 🔹 Types of Binary Trees

Here are the most important types:

---

### 1. **Full Binary Tree (Proper/Strict Binary Tree)**

👉 Every node has **either 0 or 2 children** (no node can have only 1 child).

✅ Example:

```
        10
      /   \
     20    30
    / \   / \
   40 50 60 70
```

* Every node has either 2 children (10,20,30) or 0 children (40,50,60,70).

❌ Not a full binary tree:

```
    10
   /  
  20   
```

(node 10 has only one child).

---

### 2. **Complete Binary Tree**

👉 All levels are completely filled **except possibly the last**, and all nodes in the last level are as **left as possible**.

✅ Example:

```
        10
      /    \
     20     30
    /  \   /
   40  50 60
```

* Last level is not fully filled, but nodes are filled from the left.

⚡ Heaps (like `PriorityQueue` in Java) are implemented as complete binary trees.

---

### 3. **Perfect Binary Tree**

👉 A binary tree that is **both full and complete**.

* All internal nodes have 2 children.
* All leaves are at the same level.

✅ Example:

```
        10
      /    \
     20     30
    / \    / \
   40 50  60 70
```

* Level 1: `10`
* Level 2: `20, 30`
* Level 3: `40, 50, 60, 70`

Here, every internal node has 2 children, and all leaves are on the same level.

---

### 4. **Balanced Binary Tree**

👉 A binary tree is **balanced** if for every node, the height difference between left and right subtrees is **at most 1**.

✅ Example:

```
        10
      /    \
     20     30
    /  \
   40  50
```

⚡ Balanced trees keep operations like search/insert/delete efficient (`O(log n)`).
Examples of balanced trees: **AVL tree, Red-Black Tree**.

---

### 5. **Degenerate (or Skewed) Binary Tree**

👉 A tree where **each parent has only one child**, so it behaves like a linked list.

* **Left-skewed**: all nodes have only left child.
* **Right-skewed**: all nodes have only right child.

✅ Example (Right-skewed):

```
    10
      \
      20
        \
        30
          \
          40
```

⚡ Height = number of nodes, so operations degrade to `O(n)`.

---

### 6. **Binary Search Tree (BST)**

👉 A special binary tree with an **ordering property**:

* Left child < Parent
* Right child > Parent

✅ Example:

```
        50
      /    \
     30     70
    / \    / \
   20 40  60 80
```

⚡ Inorder traversal of a BST gives sorted output.

---

### 7. **Complete vs. Full vs. Perfect** (Common confusion)

Let’s compare:

* **Full** → Every node has 0 or 2 children.
* **Complete** → All levels filled except last, last filled from left.
* **Perfect** → Both full & complete (all leaves same level).

# 🔹 Visual Summary

| Type     | Condition                                      |
| -------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| Full     | 0 or 2 children                                |
| Complete | All levels full except last, filled left→right |
| Perfect  | Full + Complete (all leaves at same depth)     |
| Balanced | Height difference ≤ 1                          |
| Skewed   | Each node has only one child                   |
| BST      | Ordered: left < root < right                   |

👉 Now, tell me — do you want me to:

1. Show you **Java implementations** to check if a tree is *full, complete, perfect, or balanced*;
2. Or move to **tree traversals** (since types + traversals usually go hand in hand)?
