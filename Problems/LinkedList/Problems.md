## 📝 **Tips to Master Linked Lists**

* Draw out pointer movements visually — helps a lot.
* Carefully handle nulls: always check next and prev.
* Dummy nodes simplify code for insertion/removal.
* Get familiar with reversing a list — it’s the base for many variations.
* Practice recursion-based and iteration-based logic for the same problems.
