# ðŸ§© Collaboration Plan for DSA with a Buddy

## 1. **Set Shared Goals**

* Define your **timeline** (e.g., "We want to get strong in DSA in 6 months").
* Define your **end goals**:

    * Crack coding interviews (FAANG / Product-based companies).
    * Build problem-solving skills (contest readiness).
    * Master patterns & problem-solving approaches.

---

## 2. **Create a Shared Setup**

* **Platform**: Pick one (LeetCode, Codeforces, GeeksforGeeks, or InterviewBit). Stick to it for consistency.
* **Shared Tracker**:

    * Use **Google Sheets / Notion / Trello** to log solved problems:

        * Problem Name
        * Difficulty (Easy/Medium/Hard)
        * Topic (Array, DP, Graphs, etc.)
        * Date solved
        * Who solved it first / both
        * Notes (learning, mistakes, optimized approach)
* **Communication**:

    * Use Discord / Slack / WhatsApp for quick discussion.
    * GitHub repo (optional): Store your implementations & notes.

---

## 3. **Daily / Weekly Routine**

### **Daily Routine (1.5â€“2 hrs)**

1. **Warm-up (10â€“15 min)**

    * Revise yesterdayâ€™s problem or quickly explain the solution to each other.
2. **Problem Solving (60â€“75 min)**

    * Pick **2 problems** (1 easy/medium, 1 medium/hard).
    * Solve individually (20â€“30 min each).
    * After solving, discuss approaches â€” donâ€™t just show the code, explain the **thinking process**.
3. **Debrief (15â€“20 min)**

    * Discuss different approaches.
    * Talk about **time complexity** and **space complexity**.
    * If stuck, break down the problem together.

### **Weekly Routine**

* **Day 1â€“5**: Topic-focused practice (e.g., Arrays â†’ Strings â†’ LinkedList â†’ Stack/Queue â†’ Recursion).
* **Day 6 (Mock Day)**:

    * Solve 3â€“4 problems in a **timed mock interview** format.
    * One person acts as interviewer, the other as interviewee.
* **Day 7 (Review Day)**:

    * Review all problems of the week.
    * Note mistakes & patterns in your tracker.

## 4. **Topic-Wise Roadmap**

1. Arrays & Hashing
2. Strings
3. Linked List
4. Stack & Queue
5. Binary Search
6. Recursion & Backtracking
7. Trees (BST, Binary Trees)
8. Heaps & Priority Queue
9. Graphs (BFS, DFS, Union-Find, Topological Sort)
10. Dynamic Programming (subproblems â†’ tabulation â†’ optimization)
11. Greedy & Miscellaneous Patterns
12. Advanced Topics (Segment Trees, Tries, Bitmasking, etc.)

---

## 5. **How to Push Each Other**

* Alternate who picks the problem daily.
* Do **explain-back sessions**: whoever solves must explain the solution to the other.
* If one person struggles, the other helps by giving **hints** instead of full solutions.
* Compete in contests together (Codeforces, LeetCode Weekly).

---

## 6. **Milestones & Accountability**

* After **every 2 weeks**, do a **mock interview session**.
* After **every month**, review:

    * # of problems solved
    * Weak areas
    * Improvement in speed and accuracy
* Celebrate small wins (crossing 100 problems, solving first hard problem, etc.).

---

âœ… **Benefits of this plan**:

* You both get independent practice **and** collaborative growth.
* Regular peer discussions sharpen your problem-solving explanations (crucial for interviews).
* Accountability ensures you stay consistent.

Would you like me to make you and your buddy a **shared DSA tracker template (Google Sheets)** with problem categorization and progress tracking? That way youâ€™ll just have to fill in problems and focus on solving.
